The goal of this portfolio was to use the Bootstrap library to create a responsive, multi-page website. 

I practiced and studied a number of skills during the execution of this assignment, including using containers, rows, and columns; creating responsive images; using empty divs to shape the page; and more. Two big surprises for me as I worked through this assignment were how useful nested rows were to shape and sculpt individual elements and sub-elements of the page and how comprehensive the Bootstrap class library was; early drafts included a bit of internal CSS to get the elements where I wanted them to be, elements that were finally unnecessary to successfully complete the assignment as assigned. 

This assignment was revised in late October, 2020, to include newer assignments, including multiple projects that worked with APIs such as Open Weather Map, OMDB, New York Times, and others. 

The assignment requested an email address and phone number, both of which are available through my LinkedIn account; there's a link there from about.html.
