                  I’m a writer, editor, web developer, and storyteller living and working in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
                  I received my M.F.A. in creative writing-fiction from the University of Michigan’s Zell Writers Program, 
                  where I won a first place Hopwood Award for Graduate Short Fiction. My writing has appeared in Painted Bride 
                  Quarterly, Michigan Quarterly Review, the Ann, and elsewhere. I’ve worked on projects for Voice of Witness/McSweeney’s, 
                  the Moth, Michigan Radio, and Litquake-San Francisco.
                </p>

                  Some of my most rewarding professional experiences have been as a teacher. I worked as an Assistant Language Teacher 
                  in Mizusawa, Japan, as part of the Japan Exchange for Teaching, and I taught all kinds of writing courses for U-M’s 
                  English Department Writing Program and a class on digital storytelling for the University of Michigan Residential College. 
                  I currently work in higher ed communications, and I write the HypeTrain 
                  pop culture newsletter.
